  <h2>About Zachman Media</h2>
  
  <p>Hey, I’m Jeff — the one-man dev shop behind Zachman Media.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve been building on the web for over a decade. I originally trained as a backend developer (top of my class, thank you very much), but I’ve grown into a full-stack creator. If it runs in a browser or on a server — I can build it.</p>

  <p>I believe in doing things the right way: clean code, handcrafted sites, no bloated templates, no gimmicks. My goal is to make things that are fast, functional, and just plain *work* — whether it’s a portfolio, a store, a blog, or a custom tool.</p>

  <p>Beyond the code, I’m also a content creator and streamer (<a href="https://twitch.tv/JZVenom" target="_blank">JZVenom on Twitch</a>). I run a community of ADHD streamers, love punk music, and have a serious comic book habit. Basically — I live and breathe nerd culture, and I bring that same passion into every project I touch.</p>

  <p>Zachman Media is my home base for offering services, sharing projects, and helping others level up their digital presence. If you want a site that isn’t cookie-cutter — if you want something built by a human who actually cares about the work — I’d love to chat.</p>
  
  <p>— Jeff Zachman</p>
